# wikipedia-search-bot
NOTE 1: This is a mini project I did for training , learning and for gaining expriences. Feel free to use my code!


"Wikipedia-search-bot" is a very simple Python-based project utilizing Tkinter that allows a user to get any information available in Wikipedia.com within the app. It relies on Selenium's capabilities for scraping content from target pages and is quite user-friendly.

Features:

    Search Wikipedia: Enter your query, and it will return with the first paragraph of its related Wikipedia webpage.

    Simple Interface: A clean and intuitively simple application user interface powered by Tkinter.

    Automation of Web Scraping: Actually automates a search and the extraction of results from Wikipedia with Selenium.

How It Works:

    The User enters a key term in an input field of the application UI.

    In response, a Chrome browser window opens, directed to Wikipedia courtesy of Selenium.

    It will search for the term, scrape the first paragraph of the Wikipedia page, and show it inside the text box.

Requirements:

    Python 3.x

    Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)

    Selenium (pip install selenium)

    ChromeDriver (ensure it matches your Chrome browser version)

    deep_translator library (pip install deep-translator)

Usage:

    Clone the repository.

    Install dependencies that will be required for execution.

    Execute the script named dont_delete_me_wiki.py.

    A query box appears where the user will insert the keyword to be searched, followed by clicking the "Submit" button to display results.

NOTE 2: I am a junior python all advices are welcomed
